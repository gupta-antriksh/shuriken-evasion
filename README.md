# shuriken-evasion
This game was created by me using pygame for a 7-day long Winter Game Jam organized by the Game Development Club, IIT Kanpur.

Later, I also added some new features and fixed bugs.

The images "/art/shurikenBlack.png", "/art/shurikenRed.png" and the images in the directory /art/bg were created using GIMP 

The sounds "/sounds/explosion.wav", "/sounds/boost.wav" "/sounds/gameOver.wav" were created using bfxr
